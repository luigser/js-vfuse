CONFIGURE NGINX WITH SSL

You need:

- An SSL cert matching the /dns4 or /dns6 name
- go-ipfs listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8081/ws
    - 8081 is just an example
    - note that it's /ws here, not /wss -- go-ipfs can't currently do SSL, see the next point
- nginx
    - configured with the SSL cert
    - listening on port 443
    - forwarding to 127.0.0.1:8081
