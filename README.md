#js-vfuse
VFuse is a decentralized library, which acts as a workflow
manager - accessible via browser - for volunteer-based distributed computation. The main purpose of VFuse is enabling
users to access a robust and secure volunteer network without
requiring the installation and configuration of any additional
software. VFuse users can define asynchronous workflows
made up by smaller functions (jobs or tasks) with possible
temporal dependencies on their execution. Thanks to the
asynchronous nature of VFuse workflows, users are free to
leave the network while their required workflow is running
and gathering its results in any moment in the future
